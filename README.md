# Detecting Evasion Techniques

## Description

Implementation for the detection techniques described in the [report about smart contract evasion techniques][report-web3-evasion] by the [Forta TRi][forta-threat-research-initiative].

Here, "evasion" refers to any tactic that deceives end-users or circumvents defense mechanisms.

## Support

The bots use the transaction traces, so they only runs on Ethereum for now.

## Alerts

### Metamorphic Contracts

The metamorphic contracts are spotted when created:

- `EVASION-METAMORPHISM-FACTORY-DEPLOYMENT`:
    - the factory address is attached as a label
- `EVASION-METAMORPHISM-MUTANT-DEPLOYMENT`:
    - the mutant address is attached as a label

For all the alerts:    

- Type is always set to `Suspicious`
- Severity is always `Info`
- Metadata:
  - `confidence`: the estimated probability of a given detection
  - `chain_id`: the chain id
  - `from`: the transaction sender
  - `to`: the transaction recipient
  - `anomaly_score`: the alert rate for this combination of bot / alert type

## Options

The bot settings are located in `src/options.py`:

```python
MIN_CONFIDENCE = 0.7 # probability threshold
ALERT_HISTORY_SIZE = 16384 # in number of transactions recorded
```

The bot only fires alerts when the probability score for a given threat is above `MIN_CONFIDENCE`.

It keeps a local history of all the alerts raised to compute stats.
The history size is set by `ALERT_HISTORY_SIZE`.

## Implementations

All the detection processes are [detailed in the report][report-web3-evasion].

## Tests

The bots use the libraries [`forta-toolkit`][github-apehex-toolkit] and [`ioseeth`][github-apehex-ioseeth], which come with extensive unit tests.

They can be run in the root directory of each of these packages with `python -m pytest`.

## Development

Contributions welcome!
